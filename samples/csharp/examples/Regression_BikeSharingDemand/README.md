# Bike Sharing Demand - Regression problem sample

## DataSet
The original data comes from a public UCI dataset:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset

## Problem

This problem is centered around predicting the Bike Sharing Demand based on historic data from the previous DataSet.


## ML task - Regression

The ML Task is Regression, however, this example trains multiple models each one based on a different learner/algorithm and finally evaluates the accuracy of each approach, so you can choose the trained model with better accuracy.
The following list are the trainers/algorithms used and compared:

- FastTreeRegressor
- FastForestRegressor
- PoissonRegressor
- OnlineGradientDescentRegressor
- FastTreeTweedieRegressor
- GeneralizedAdditiveModelRegressor
- StochasticDualCoordinateAscentRegressor
